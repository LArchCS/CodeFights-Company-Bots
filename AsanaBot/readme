Asanabot was the first one I beat (when I created my CodeFight account)..

I did not notice this is a company bot, and just went through the programming tasks without keeping my codes for the first 2 tasks.

The code here is for the third task, which is like a calendar reminder:
1. 4 inputs as 
    a) firstDate:  a string, indicating the first day of the task
    b) k: an integer, indicating after how many weeks should the reminder repeat
    c) daysOfTheWeek: a list of strings, indicating on which weekday should the calendar remind
    d) n: an integer, remind the task for n times
2. output:
    a) a list of strings, indicating the first n dates

The difficult part is to to traslate string into date, and date into string, also need to consider leap years and cases when the calender reminder spans across years(also need to consider leap years).

# CodeFights-Company-Bots

Beating the company bots on CodeFights is interesting.
It also allows me (a computer science student without industry experience) to explore how prgramming are used in different service sectors.

There are 3 programming when fight with a company bot. To win, you will need to hit a minimum score (sometimes does not need to finish all 3 tasks). Usually the first two assignments are easy and can be done in 3-5 minutes. The third one usually takes me more than half an hour to code, test, and debug.

My goal is to complete all 3 programming tasks without bugs and get full score (900).

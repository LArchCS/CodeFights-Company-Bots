# CodeFights-Company-Bots

Beating the company bots on CodeFights is interesting.
It also allows me (a computer science student without industry experience) to explore how prgramming are used in different service sectors.

There are 3 programming when fight with a company bot. To win, you will need to hit a minimum score. My goal is to complete all 3 programming tasks without bugs and get full score (900).
